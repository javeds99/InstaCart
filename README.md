# InstaCart

InstaCart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. The stakeholders want to answer business questions using data driven answers. The questions include:
- What are the busiest days/busiest times of the day?
- What time of the day generates the most revenue?
- Are certain types of proucts more popular than others?
- What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles?
- The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.
